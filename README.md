# retracker_comparison_tool

This tool is based on S6 GPP Comissioning waveform fitting tool. 
This tool over-plots the L1B power echoes with the theoretical model fit. 
The tool also provides the estimate of (altitude-range), Sigma-0, SWH, measure of goodness of fit and parameter comparison plots. 
The function is able to loop through all power echoes in a given level 1B file or L2 file.
